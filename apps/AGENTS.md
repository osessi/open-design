# apps/AGENTS.md

Follow the root `AGENTS.md` first. This file only records module-level boundaries for `apps/`.

## Active apps

- `apps/web`: Next.js 16 App Router + React 18 web runtime. Entrypoints live in `apps/web/app/`; the main client shell is `apps/web/src/App.tsx`. During local `tools-dev` web runs, `apps/web/next.config.ts` rewrites `/api/*`, `/artifacts/*`, and `/frames/*` to `OD_PORT`.
- `apps/daemon`: Express + SQLite local daemon and `od` bin. It owns REST/SSE APIs, agent CLI spawning, skills, design systems, artifact persistence, static serving, and local data under `.od/`.
- `apps/desktop`: Electron shell. Desktop does not guess the web port; it reads runtime status through sidecar IPC and opens the reported web URL.

## Daemon layout

- `apps/daemon/src/` contains only daemon app source.
- `apps/daemon/tests/` contains daemon tests.
- `apps/daemon/sidecar/` contains the daemon sidecar entry.
- CLI/agent argument changes or stdout parser changes belong in `apps/daemon/src/agents.ts` and the matching parser tests.

## Sidecar awareness

- App business layers must not import sidecar packages or branch on `runtime.mode`, `namespace`, `ipc`, or `source`.
- Keep sidecar awareness in `apps/<app>/sidecar` or the desktop sidecar entry wrapper.

## Inactive app directories

- `apps/nextjs` has been removed; do not restore it.
- `apps/packaged` is a minimal placeholder for future packaged app assembly. Do not add a package manifest, runtime code, or lifecycle script there in this round.
